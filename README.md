# ios_bezier_curve_to_point

This is an iOS Swift repository for Bezier path handling. when we drag touch we find some points, actually location of the continuous touches in the creen. when draw them we find line. but if we drag very fast, the line become discrete.


The main purpose of this repository is to represent bezier curve in continuous points, traversing the curve with some proper mathmatical implications.

the main theory & algorithms was taken from here https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/
